      <description>Funny toy. From the name it may seem that it has something to do with the cartoon about training the dragon. But it is not so. The essence of the game is as follows. Viking (that is, you) gets the task to run a certain distance. He will move on his own. Your task is to remove obstacles and collect coins. If the character hesitates, then the dragon will devour him.</description>
