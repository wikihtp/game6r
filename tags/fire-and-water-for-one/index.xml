      <description>A very interesting game for two, in which you will need to make your way up the platforms, collecting bonuses along the way and trying your best not to die. After all, if the Fire falls into a large lake of water, it will go out. Just like Water can not get into the lava, because it can evaporate. Move simultaneously along the intended path, helping each other.</description>
