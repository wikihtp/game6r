      <description>Do you want to laugh heartily and look at completely stoned football players? This can be done while playing Football Physics for two. By the way, it also has a single player mode. Side view. The character drawing is very cool. There are not athletes on the field, but more and more some hippies, rastamans and other rabble. Matches are played in a two-on-two format. There is no point in voicing the goal, it is clear and so.</description>
