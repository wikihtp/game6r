      <description>You are on a desert island. There is not a soul around, only bloodthirsty sharks live in coastal waters. The danger is that the water level is rising, and predators are ready to deal with you at any second. It&amp;rsquo;s good that blocks are falling from the sky, lining up on the ground in a pyramid.
