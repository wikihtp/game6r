      <description>As you can already guess from the name of the game, you have to crush the walking dead and other creatures in a car. A third-person view, that is, from behind and a little from above, and besides, with a claim to 3D. For the destroyed creatures you get money. They can be spent in the store to upgrade the car, buy weapons and ammunition.</description>
