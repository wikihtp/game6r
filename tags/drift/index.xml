      <description>If you like racing with a view from above and, at the same time, not too dynamic, then you will enjoy playing Car Drift. Despite the small size of all objects, their drawing is not bad. The animation is nothing special, but no one demanded anything of the sort from it. The essence is very simple and pretty standard: drive around the tracks and drift around corners. Of course, it is desirable to come to the finish line before your competitors.</description>
