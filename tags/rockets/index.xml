      <description>If all your life you dreamed of becoming a tester and pyrotechnician, then you definitely should try this game. Somewhere in the mountains there is a launch pad. You need to launch a rocket up and try to fly to the stars. It won&amp;rsquo;t work right away. But for each launch, money will be charged. And still collect crystals. Spend them on upgrades and climb higher and higher.</description>

      <description>The Rocket game is designed for those who want to kill time, but not really strain at the same time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be anything special. As well as frantically hitting the keyboard. All you have to do is launch the rocket and make it fly as high as possible. Collect bonuses along the way. Basically, these are coins and cans of fuel. By the way, it can be useful to fly not strictly up, but deviating to the sides - more surprises.</description>

      <description>A very simple toy. Yes, and the passage is not particularly difficult. But it is very bright and will appeal to even the smallest users. If only they knew how to hold a mouse in their hands and use it to move a flying rocket left and right. The goal is maximum points. To increase the speed, just collect the crystals.</description>

      <description>This game is somewhat similar to billiards. Only instead of balls here is a rocket. One. The goal is to pick up an astronaut. The trick is that the rocket needs to be launched in such a way that it, bouncing off the planets and the borders of the screen, catches the little man. Complexity - a limited supply of fuel. Each stage is more difficult than the previous one.</description>

      <description>The backstory of the game Rocket to the Moon is very funny. Worth a look. By the way, the drawing is also top notch! And the process itself is amusing. The bottom line is that you have to pilot a spacecraft launched to the satellite of our planet. Use the keys and follow the instructions. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to upgrade before each new attempt.</description>

      <description>While playing Rocket to Space you have to learn to think quickly and logically. To train this valuable quality, fifteen stages are given. They get progressively more difficult. The essence, by and large, is very simple. There is a rocket at the starting point. And there is a finish line. The spacecraft must get to it using intermediate stops - cubes. For maximum credit on points, you need to do everything in the minimum time.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the test site where the Mars rocket will be tested. And you will do it. The essence is simple, like a cork: you need to launch a rocket as high as possible. It would be nice to collect bonuses along the way. But the aircraft is poorly controlled. An upgrade will help the case, with the help of which you will also attach all sorts of useful jokes to it.</description>
