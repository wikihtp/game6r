      <description>Today you have the opportunity to help the pterodactyl collect all the scattered eggs from which his brothers and sisters should hatch. Control the movements of the dinosaur with the mouse, flying and landing, for example, on tree branches. But remember, there will always be enemies who can prevent you from completing the task.</description>

      <description>A very good game in the style of &amp;ldquo;protect the towers&amp;rdquo; in Russian. In it you will fight with dinosaurs and other enemies of different eras. You have to create simple devices that cause damage to the enemy. At the first level, these will be the simplest weapons. The main thing is the correct placement of weapons on the path of the enemy.</description>

      <description>Not everyone knows, but tyrannosaurs could easily reach speeds of up to 70 km / h. I can’t even believe that an animal with a mass of several tons is capable of such agility. Help the monster from this game to run the distance, overcoming multiple obstacles on the way. To control the character you only need the left mouse button.</description>
