      <description>A very addictive game with nice graphics that will surely seem familiar to those who remember the first part of &amp;ldquo;Truckers&amp;rdquo;. First you choose a car (SUV or truck) and the type of race. When the race starts, try not only to keep the car on the track, but also collect useful items (money, fuel, nitrogen). Getting to the finish line, and even more so to win, will be very difficult.</description>

      <description>Not particularly difficult, but nevertheless an interesting game. You drive a truck that speeds along the track from left to right. Your competitors are trying to overtake you. You can block them with your car or turn on the nitrous oxide at the right time. Along the way, collect canisters, magnets (help collect bonuses from a distance) and coins. If you win, you move on to the next stage, and upgrade your truck with the points earned.</description>
