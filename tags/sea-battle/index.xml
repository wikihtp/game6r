      <description>In this game you can enjoy a real naval battle of different types of ships. Everything happens almost the same as in a sea battle, which many people play on notebook sheets. First you place the ships on the sea surface, and then you enter the battle with your opponent. Only unlike a notebook, almost three-dimensional graphics await you on the screen.</description>
