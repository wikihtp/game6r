      <description>The action of this game takes place in a saloon, somewhere in the wild Wild West. You have to put on a cowboy costume and take part in a fight. The game is three-dimensional and very cool. In it, you can grab tables, chairs, smash them on the head of an opponent, or throw one cowboy into a crowd of others. But be careful not to let the opponents close to you from the rear.</description>

Move around the old house and search the rooms for items that will help you destroy the monsters and save your life at any cost. It would be nice to be the first to find a pistol or shotgun.</description>
