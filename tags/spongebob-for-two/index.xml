      <description>SpongeBob was caught, put in a cage and is about to be sent to a living corner, to an aquarium. Patrick managed to get a girlfriend somewhere, and now the two of them are in a hurry to help Bob. The game is designed exclusively for two players, but you can play alone if you control both characters at once. This approach is very useful for the development of both hemispheres of the brain.</description>
