      <description>The game is reminiscent of the good old &amp;ldquo;tanchiki&amp;rdquo;. Only here is cooler graphics, physics, soundtrack. You need to protect the base so that other tanks cannot destroy it. Around a large brick wall, which is not so difficult to break through. A few volleys will be enough, so you need to respond in time to each breakthrough of the enemy.</description>
