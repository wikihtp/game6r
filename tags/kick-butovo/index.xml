      <description>The game Kik Butovsky will tell you about another invention of the famous cartoon extreme. Every day his tricks become more unusual and dangerous. Today, he uses a mega-cool trampoline that he made and installed in his backyard. Kik wants to make a crazy launch and set a new range for his flights. Now, for acceleration, he uses not just the angle of descent, but a mechanism with an elastic band.</description>

      <description>Kik Butovsky got his own car. But to ride, like all people through the streets, he is bored, so he had to come up with fun for himself. His car will fly into the air like a pebble from a slingshot. You will have to help her: pull the elastic band as hard as you can, and then Kik will fly very high. And then do not yawn - with the help of buttons you can control the flight in the air.</description>
