      <description>The game Rules of War nuclear strategy will make even the lazy one play, if, of course, you figure out what&amp;rsquo;s what. This is not difficult. You can not even look at the instructions, although it will not be superfluous. The whole nuclear strategy is to move your armored tractor from stage to stage and gradually build blocks to it. From time to time there are clashes with the enemy and then a real nuclear war begins.</description>

      <description>The World War II Strategy game has a fairly extensive menu that allows you to set the desired settings, select the mode you like, and also see the instructions. It will be of little use if you do not speak English, so you will have to figure it out along the way. However, life will be a little easier with the introductory video, which, if desired, can be skipped. So, the events of the game Strategy 2 World War take place in 1944.</description>
