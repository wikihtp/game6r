      <description>In the dark ages, the rules of survival are very simple: either you destroy potential enemies, or they destroy you and take over your lands. So in this game, the goal is to conquer the territory (see the map at the beginning) one by one and get to the castle. There are no special difficulties and strategies. The main thing is to send suitable troops towards the enemy.</description>

      <description>You can skip the long text background. There is nothing useful in it, except for 100500 English letters. Next comes the learning phase with endless instructions. Disabling will not work. But then everything is simple: build a base, train troops, rob caravans and wipe enemies with their castles into dust. In addition to conventional troops, you can choose magical support.</description>

      <description>This game is somewhat similar to chess. In any case, in addition to brandishing a sword, gamers will also sometimes have to turn on their brains. As for the rest, everything is the same as in many similar games: you move from location to location on the map, and when you stop, you enter into an unequal battle with ghoul ghouls. There are all sorts of upgrades.</description>

      <description>The game is as simple as a pine board! You choose a character: archer-man or archer-woman. All. You are standing on the right side of the screen in the outfit of an English archer, and on the left you are being attacked by enemies. Apparently, these are some kind of Saracens. If they reach your character, they will start slashing very quickly with a sword and then it will be over.</description>

      <description>Everything is simple here: there are two locks. One belongs to the enemy, and the other belongs to you. The task is to protect your castle from destruction and wipe out the enemy. Before the start of the battles, you can choose the level of difficulty, the option of passing the game, as well as see the instructions (which will help you quickly understand the controls). The graphics do not shine, but they tried to compensate for this shortcoming with dynamism.</description>

      <description>The developer company &amp;ldquo;Armor Games&amp;rdquo; again pleases us with its creation. The gameplay is preceded by a story. It can be skipped. However, a quick immersion in the fever of battles still does not work. After all, you are dealing with a turn-based strategy. It is recommended to look closely at the tips and think through your moves well.</description>

      <description>A game that requires the player to be able to make decisions quickly is somewhat similar to checkers. The plot is like this. There are two castles: yours and the enemy&amp;rsquo;s. Troops are constantly generated there, which must be sent to capture buildings. On the first level, there are only two castles. The farther, the more buildings appear on the screen. The captured building automatically becomes a barracks.</description>

      <description>You can start a new game or choose an old save if you have one. You can skip the long introduction, it&amp;rsquo;s still in English. Then, after some preparations, you can finally start playing. Its essence is reduced to the defense of your castle from enemies. The defense must smoothly turn into an attack, because the flow of enemies is endless. The purpose of the attack: destroy the enemy castle.</description>
