      <description>The macaw parrot is a rather large bird with very bright plumage and a strong beak. In the game, you have to try to color the image of the bird with the help of a brush and the suggested jars of paint. The color outline of the picture will tell you exactly which shade you need to choose for coloring a particular fragment.</description>
