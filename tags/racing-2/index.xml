      <description>An exciting game Racing for two 2 will take you to a distant planet, where you will participate in competitions. But first, do not forget to choose a character whose car you have to drive. Local cars do not look quite familiar, they are more like spaceships that fly through the air. This makes the process of racing on 2 even more fun. Game ups and downs include a large number of levels, and on each of them you have a specific goal: you need to overtake rivals in order to reach the finish line first.</description>
