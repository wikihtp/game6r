      <description>In candy land, you are invited to solve a Tetris-like puzzle by finding straight or broken lines from colored candies. If found, click. Accumulations of sweets are burned, the top ones are shifted down and new ones are added. And you get points accordingly. The more lollipops you burn at once, the more points you earn.</description>

At the bottom of the screen you will see items and things that you need to remove by clicking on them with the left button.</description>
