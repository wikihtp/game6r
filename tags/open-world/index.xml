      <description>In this game, you can take a break from completing abstruse quests, leveling up the magical skills of characters and sharpening swords. Instead, you are invited to ride a car and destroy everything around. At the end of the race, you can even detonate a bomb to achieve maximum destruction. The goal is to Crazy Games as many points as possible before the time runs out.</description>

      <description>It cannot be said that you have a real open-world game in front of you, because it does have certain boundaries. But, nevertheless, a pleasant pastime is guaranteed. At your disposal will be a character armed initially with a sword. Then it will be possible to pick up another weapon (by the way, it affects objects differently). Walk, fight monsters, collect treasures.</description>
