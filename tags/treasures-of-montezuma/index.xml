      <description>An exciting logic game in the style of &amp;ldquo;three in a row&amp;rdquo;. To begin with, try to move the colored stones in such a way as to make a line of three elements of the same shape and color. The figures lined up in this order burn out and new ones appear in their place. The more stones in a row disappear, the more points and bonuses you earn.</description>
