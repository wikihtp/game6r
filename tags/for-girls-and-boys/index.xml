      <description>In this game you have to go to the beach where a cat and a dog have decided to have a mock battle. Decide whether you will fight a real opponent or a virtual one. After that, it remains only to attack the enemy, trying to hit him with projectiles that take away health points. Their number is fixed at the top of the screen.</description>
