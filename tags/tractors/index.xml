      <description>According to the terms of Tractors 2, you need to tow a broken car and simply deliver it to the garage, which is located nearby. First, back up a little to hook the car with a cable. Then slowly hit the road, because you need to bring your cargo safe and sound. Therefore, do not accelerate and carefully overcome obstacles.</description>
