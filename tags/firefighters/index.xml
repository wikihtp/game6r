      <description>Firefighters are not only those who put out fires. These are the drivers of red cars, and the dispatcher receiving the distress signal. Test yourself in the role of each of them: by pressing the right keys, transfer the call to the rescue team, deftly turning the steering wheel, take the team to the fire site, and then set the stairs to the upper floors of the burning house. In this game you have to go through 4 levels.</description>

      <description>Today you have a responsible job. You need to get to the place of the fire in a certain time and park your truck there. If the car is damaged during the parking process, or if you do not have time to meet the regular time, this will be regarded as a mission failure. With each new level, the task will gradually become more difficult, so be careful.</description>
