      <description>Before starting the game, you should watch a colorful introductory video. From it you will learn many funny legends associated with its main characters. This will be followed by a visual instruction (in Russian, by the way, language) and, finally, the game itself. As a matter of fact, this is far from a walker, but a real race with a bucket of sauce, which must be saved.</description>

      <description>In this game, SpongeBob participates in an underwater race on a slippery surface. Developing almost space speed, the character runs forward, jumps over chasms and collects hamburgers along the way. But besides that, you still need to overtake the snail (it is shown at the top of the screen on the strip). If the snail reaches the finish line first, the hamburgers won&amp;rsquo;t come in handy.</description>
