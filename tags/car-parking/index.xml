      <description>Even if you&amp;rsquo;re in a patrol car, don&amp;rsquo;t think that you can do everything: crash into other cars, park like an asshole, and so on. The game will clearly demonstrate this. Your task is extremely simple: put the police car in the parking lot in the indicated place. The route is marked with arrows, follow them. A few minor hitting obstacles - the game is over.</description>

      <description>Although you drive a limousine, this does not mean that you can automatically park anywhere and any way you like - there are cars and cooler ones. So, don&amp;rsquo;t ooh, don&amp;rsquo;t ah, but turn the steering wheel and put this monster in its place. At the next levels, you will have to park other cars, and each time in a different way. Each stage can be replayed, bringing to perfection.</description>
