      <description>The Chess for Two game was created specifically for beginners who are not yet very good at thinking through a game strategy. A friend or even a computer will help you learn. Start the game, study the possible moves and act. Perform each of them, find out what it can lead to and, perhaps, find a path that will lead to the defeat of your opponent.</description>
