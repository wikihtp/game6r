      <description>A beautiful toy with 3D graphics and a side view. The kids will definitely like it, because there are such cute characters! The process of passing consists of many stages, during which the main character rides a horse and picks vegetables. The task is to deliver them to the sheriff (he is waiting at the end of the level).</description>
