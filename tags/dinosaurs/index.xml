      <description>If you want to take part in the adventures of funny ancient lizards, then the Dinosaur Age game is quite suitable for this. There are two characters - a large one and a small one, but they are controlled alternately. At the same time, a small dinosaur either sits on the back of a fellow, or embarks on a journey itself, during which it is necessary to collect coins. The heroes of the game help each other in overcoming obstacles.</description>
