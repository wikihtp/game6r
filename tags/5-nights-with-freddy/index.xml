      <description>Before you is a children&amp;rsquo;s version of the game (monsters are not so scary) about the adventures of a security guard in a night eatery. He is not as scary as all the others, but no less difficult. It is necessary to monitor the rooms with surveillance cameras. The doors can be closed, but in this position their batteries are discharged. No power - the doors are open. You can hide in a mask, but also temporarily.</description>

      <description>This game looks not at all scary and even somehow small. In the sense that all the details and characters in it are small. Side view. Keyboard control. Your hero is a little golden teddy bear. He needs to find and enter all the codes for the lock that locks the elevator doors. So, passing through all the rooms, look for clues. The elevator, of course, is located at the farthest.</description>

      <description>In some way, in front of you is a parody or banter on the game about Freddie the bear. At first glance, everything is exactly the same: you are a night guard, you sit in a closet and monitor the premises through security cameras. But instead of crazy monsters, there are soft toys here. You can hide from their embrace under a mask. The goal is to last all night.</description>

      <description>Before you is a very interesting interpretation of the famous horror about 5 nights with Freddie. A kind of cross between this game and Minecraft. View, as before, from the first person. You are sitting in a mine, and 4 tunnels stretch ahead. Watch the torches in them so that they do not go out, and sometimes drive away the monsters. You also need to turn on the fan in time.</description>

      <description>Imagine that you had to get a job as a security guard in a hotel. However, already on the first watch, it became clear that something strange was happening in the building, and monsters from nightmares - animatronic robots - were hiding around every corner. Your task, controlling only the mouse, is to monitor all the corridors of the hotel and, at the slightest danger, abruptly lock the doors. Fortunately, there are security cameras on the floors.</description>

      <description>Yes, the job of a night watchman can be difficult. Especially if you work in a cafe with crazy killer dolls. Whoever wants to make sure of this, let him launch the game as soon as possible. But it is worth stocking up on sedatives. The atmosphere is still there! First-person view. Your character doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually move. Follow the monsters through the cameras and take action in time.</description>
