      <description>A beautiful game awaits you with three-dimensional graphics and good sound effects (however, they are often covered by music). You have to ride a big truck with a trailer and drive it from place to place, according to the task received at each new level. The truck has good handling, so that, with due attention, the game is quite passable.</description>
