      <description>In order to become the winner of the game Mahjong logical butterflies, you will need attentiveness and ingenuity.

As soon as two identical wings are found, they turn into a beautiful butterfly, which, waving its newly acquired wings at you, flies off the screen. Be careful and try to create all the butterflies as quickly as possible, because the time to complete the task is limited.</description>

      <description>The Butterfly Mahjong game is one of the variants of the popular puzzle game, which is laid out on the table not in the form of a pyramid, but in one plane. The rules, however, do not change in this case - only tiles located at the edges work. They depict halves of beautiful butterflies, and if you find paired fragments, they will connect, and the whole butterfly will fly away.</description>
