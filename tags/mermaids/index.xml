      <description>The cute princess turned into a little mermaid and went in search of precious pearls. During the game Beautiful Mermaid Sofia, you are invited to help the girl get pearls, which come across in shells at almost every turn. Just navigate the underwater space collecting pearls. The progress of their collection is displayed on the scale at the top of the screen. Try not to bump into swimming fish and algae, otherwise the amount of received jewelry will decrease.</description>
