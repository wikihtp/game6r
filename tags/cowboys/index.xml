So, the essence of the passage is that the main character must participate in endless fights on the streets of the town of the times of the Wild West. Fights are group fights. The number of participants is 5-6 people. Principle: every man for himself.</description>

      <description>This is a very interesting game, despite the fact that it belongs to a series of shooting games in a virtual shooting range. First, each level consists of several stages. You can shoot hundreds of enemies, but not go to the next stage. And the point is to kill a certain number of bandits in the allotted time. Buy useful things with the money you earn.</description>
