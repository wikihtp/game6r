      <description>Mind-blowing race with the participation of Spider-Man. He cooperates with the police and currently controls the section of the road leading out of the city. You will receive signals about bandits&amp;rsquo; cars and you will need to help the hero catch up with them and stop them, pressing them to the side of the road. But offenders are not averse to using this method, so be careful.</description>
